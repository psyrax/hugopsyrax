## A better app to find bikes
This project is an API with web,iOS and Pebble cients, made to improve the UX of finding a bike using Mexico City's Ecobici service. It pulls data from [http://www.citybik.es/] (http://www.citybik.es/) and the official bike endpoint.

Was made using NodeJS for the webapp and the API, Objective-c on the iOS app, JS for the pebble app.
